#This script written for "Benji", March 19, 2012
#Thanks to Michael B. Smith, Joe Shonk and Stephane Thirion for testing and fine-tuning tips 

#Version 6.00 is based on 5.21
#

#Version 6.01 25-Jan-2021
#	Added error checking in Function Check-NeededPSSnapins (Requested by Guy Leech)
#	Added new parameter LimitTargetDevices
#		Updated Function OutputSite 
#		Updated functions ShowScriptOptions and ProcessScriptEnd
#	Updated the help text
#	Updated the ReadMe file

#Version 6.00 18-Jan-2021
#	Added new function OutputNotice
#		Change some Warnings to Notices using OutputNotice
#	Added new function SetFileNames as replacement for SetFileNames1and2
#	Added the PVS Version to functions ShowScriptInfo and ProcessScriptEnd
#	Added to the Computer Hardware section, the server's Power Plan
#	Allow multiple output formats. You can now select any combination of HTML, MSWord, PDF, or Text
#	Changed all Write-Verbose statements from Get-Date to Get-Date -Format G as requested by Guy Leech
#	Changed getting the path for the PVS module from the environment variable for "ProgramFiles" to the console installation path (Thanks to Guy Leech)
#	Changed some Write-Error to Write-Warning and changed some Write-Warning to Write-Host
#	Changed the default output to HTML
#	Cleanup HTML, MSWord, PDF, and text output
#	Fixed remaining $Null comparisons where $null was on the right instead of the left of the comparison
#	Reformatted Appendix A to make it fit the content better
#	If you select PDF for Output and Microsoft Word is not installed, update the error message to state that PDF uses Word's SaveAs PDF function
#	Reformatted most Write-Error message to show better in the console
#	Removed all invalid links from comments
#	Removed all comments referencing versions before 6.00
#	Removed existing Script ParameterSets and left only one for "WordPDF"
#	Remove the Password parameter to keep from having the password entered as plaintext
#		Use Get-Credential and code from Frank Lindenblatt to get the password from the $credential object
#		The Set-PvsConnection uses only a plaintext password
#		If you get prompted for credentials, you can blame Citrix for their poorly written and dumb Set-PvsConnection cmdlet. 
#		It returns no information or status. To stop using a plain text password (the main impetus behind this update), I switched to using Get-Credential. 
#		Because of the almost useless Set-PvsConnection cmdlet, I don't know if you entered valid credentials or not or why the connection attempt to the PVS server failed.
#	Removed the requirement for elevation when remoting to the PVS server
#	Reordered the parameters in an order recommended by Guy Leech
